    <h1>Accompanying Anthropology</h1>
    <p>One may be thinking..."Anthropology can't be <em>just</em> be about bones?"</p>
    <p>And your <strong>exactly</strong> right!</p>
    <p>Anthropology isn't just <strong>ONE</strong> thing, it branches into 4 subfields:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Archaeology Anthropology:</strong> Study and interpretation of past societies and cultures from the beginning of times to now</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural Anthropology:</strong> Study of origins, history, and development of human culture</li>
        <li><strong>Biological Anthropology:</strong> Study of biological aspects of human beings, both past and present</li>
        <li><strong>Linguistic Anthropology:</strong> Study of language</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Although they all sound <em>beyond</em> intriguing to learn about, this page is more filled, content wise, with details about the <strong>Biological Anthropology</strong> subfield versus the other 3.</p>
    <p>Feel free to <em>dig</em> into those subfields after familiarizing yourself with what content I provided within this enclypodeia.</p>
